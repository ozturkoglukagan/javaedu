//Create two arrays of size 20. The first array should be an integer array, whose name is your first name,

//Of course, you need to replace the Turkish characters with their associated Latin characters (e.g., kundakcioglu). öztürkoğlu ozturkoglu

//Place the first 20 numbers in an Erhunacci sequence in the first array, which was an integer array. 
//Numbers in Erhunacci sequence satisfy : the n-th number is (2 times n-1st) + (5 times n-2nd) - (n-3rd). 

//The first 3 numbers are 9 0 and 3. So the fourth number should be 2*3 + 5*0 - 9 = -3. Of course, the first number goes to index zero inside the array. 
//--
//Next, for each number check out if they are positive and divisible by 3. If so, the associated entry on the second boolean array must be true. Otherwise, it should be false. So they look as follows:

//erhun = [9 0 3 -3 ...]

//kundakcioglu = [true false true false ...]
