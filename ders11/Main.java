// Again, besides the OOP basics I test in this question (classes, methods, enhanced for loops, 
// some data structures such as ArrayList and HashMaps), make sure you can use Random objects
//  well for this exam. You should be able to randomly pick among a set of alternatives, 
//  represent any probability mass function, calculate the long-term fraction of occurrence 
//  of some event, and the expected time until the occurrence of some event.
